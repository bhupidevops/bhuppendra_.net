Steps to Create the Fraud Detection System
1. Set Up the Development Environment
Install Python and Django for backend development.
Install necessary libraries for fraud detection and API handling.
Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
2. Create a Django Project
Initialize a new Django project for fraud detection.
Create an app within the project to handle fraud-related logic.
3. Define the Data Model
Create a database model for storing transactions.
Include fields like transaction ID, user ID, amount, timestamp, and fraud status.
Apply database migrations to store the transaction data.
4. Implement Fraud Detection Logic
Define a simple rule-based fraud detection system (e.g., flagging large transactions).
Process transactions and mark them as fraudulent or safe based on predefined conditions.
5. Create APIs for Fraud Analysis
Build RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework.
Implement an API that accepts transaction details and checks if it is fraudulent.
Return a response indicating whether fraud is detected.
6. Develop the Frontend
Use HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript for a simple user interface.
Provide a button for users to submit transactions and see fraud analysis results.
Display the result dynamically on the page.
7. Connect Frontend with Backend
Use JavaScript (Fetch API) to call the fraud detection API.
Send transaction details to the backend and display the response on the webpage.
8. Run and Test the System
Start the Django server and open the application in a browser.
Test fraud detection by submitting different transaction values.
9. Deploy the Application
Use Docker to package the application for deployment.
Deploy on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing transaction history.
10. Improve and Scale the System
Integrate Machine Learning for advanced fraud detection.
Use an event-driven approach (Kafka or RabbitMQ) for real-time fraud analysis.
Implement user authentication and role-based access control for security.
